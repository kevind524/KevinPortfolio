# Kevin Dao Portfolio

## Welcome! 

This is my portfolio of the project I have worked on thus far! My goal here is to give you some sense as to my general understanding of code and functionality between different coding software. These probably aren't the furthest I have gone with my knowledge in code but these are definitely the most complete project I can share.

### ASP.NET:

         This Visual Studio project is a project started from my capstone at Bellevue College.
         The project builds a website upon execution that has the user login using ASP.NET.
         After logging in the user's login time is pushed to the SQL database on Azure.
         
### Stored Procedure:

         This zip folder contains 4 SQL files. 
         Dao_SPROC_Portfolio is the main file to create the sample database.
         The other 3 SQL files are just stored procedures that run off DAO_SPROC_Portfolio.
         They are mostly the same between each of them and each have test cases on the bottom.

### PokerProject: 

         C# Visual Studio project containing a poker game using OOP. 
         Player will play against the program.
         Open PokerProject.sln in Visual Studio.
         Execute Program.cs to run the poker game.
         More detail on code in file.
