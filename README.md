# Kevin Portfolio

Welcome! 
This is my portfolio of the project I have worked on thus far! My goal here is to give you some sense as to my general understanding of code and functionality between different coding software. These probably aren't the furthest I have gone with my knowledge in code but these are definitely the most complete project I can share.

Stored Procedure - This zip folder contains 4 SQL files. 
                   Dao_SPROC_Portfolio is the main file I created to create a database to run the other 3 stored procedure queries.
                   The other 3 SQL files are just stored procedures. They are mostly the same between each of them and each have test                        cases on the bottom.

PokerProject - C# program containing a poker game using OOP. Player will play against the program.
               Open PokerProject.sln in Visual Studio.
               Execute Program.cs to run the poker game.
               More detail on code in file.
