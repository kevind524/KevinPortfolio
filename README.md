# Kevin Portfolio

Welcome! 

This is my portfolio of the project I have worked on thus far! My goal here is to give you some sense as to my general understanding of code and functionality between different coding software. These probably aren't the furthest I have gone with my knowledge in code but these are definitely the most complete project I can share.

Stored Procedure:
         This zip folder contains 4 SQL files. 
         Dao_SPROC_Portfolio is the main file to create the sample database.
         The other 3 SQL files are just stored procedures that run off DAO_SPROC_Portfolio.
         They are mostly the same between each of them and each have test cases on the bottom.

PokerProject: 
         C# Visual Studio project containing a poker game using OOP. 
         Player will play against the program.
         Open PokerProject.sln in Visual Studio.
         Execute Program.cs to run the poker game.
         More detail on code in file.

DAL C#:
         This Visual Studio project that shows work with Data Access Layer.
         The project builds a website upon execution that has the user login.
         After logging in the user has the choice of creating a new item entry that will be 
         stored on the SQL database or lookup items.
